# Personal Website V2 - The Front End
A new version of my personal website/data analytics blog that I started working on late January 2023. 

This repository contains the front end for the newer version of my personal website. It's written using ReactJS. I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) components to do the bulk of the styling and created the charts with [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US). 

The app is not live yet as of this writing. I'm hoping to get it going very soon, but everything is dependant on how much spare time I have.

## /Components
### /Misc
Componets for *Page Not Found* (404) and *Page in Progress*.
### /Posts
Contains sub directories with code specific to each blog entry. Each of those may have more sub directories for charts, hooks, utils, etc.
### /Utils
General utils that will be re used between more than one entry. I anticipate this containing a lot of styledComponents.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
